## Checkpoint day!
Please fork and check out your own branch and work individually.

Challenge repo: https://github.com/CodingCorpsMarin/ajax-checkpoint-challenge

You may use Google, old exercises, me, anything except for each other for assistance. 

When you are done, make a pull request so that I can see your work.


Good luck and happy hacking!
